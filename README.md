# npmTogether
## Steps
1. Create your own npm package. It should export a function that takes two arguments: 
a number and a callback function. Do a calculation inside setTimeout and after the calculation 
call the callback function passing null as error and the result of your calculation as success parameter.
2. In your (c9) machine type: "npm login" (Username: webtechtut // PW: [mentionied in Tutorium] // Email: alessandro.schneider@campus.tu-berlin.de)
3. Type "npm whoami" to see if you are logged in
4. Type: "npm publish --access public"
5. Take a coffee â˜•
6. Create a new npm package.
7. Install your previous uploaded package as a dependency and also your neighbours package.
8. Call one of the two functions and inside the callback call the second one. The inner callback should console log the final result.
